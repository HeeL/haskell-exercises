# Haskell Exercises

This repository is a collection of small haskell programms. Most of them wouldn't deserve to be a separate repository. Each branch is a separate exercise. It can be just one file or a Stack Project with tests and code that make them green. This repo has been created for learning purposes.

## Here are some branches that are worth a look:

[Leap Year](https://github.com/HeeL/haskell-exercises/tree/leap-year)
[Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/HeeL/haskell-exercises/tree/collatz-conjecture)
