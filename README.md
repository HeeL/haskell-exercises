This repository is a collection of small haskell programs. Most of them wouldn't deserve to be a separate repository. Each directory is a separate exercise. It can be just one file or a Stack Project with tests and code that make them green. This repo has been created for learning purposes.

## Here are some exercises that are worth a look:

* [Leap Year](https://github.com/HeeL/haskell-exercises/tree/master/leap)
* [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/HeeL/haskell-exercises/tree/master/collatz-conjecture)
